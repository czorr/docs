## **What is Metabrain?**

![Metabrain Overview](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1153b6b1-2569-46bc-9e53-6a94d83691dd/68f05985-c627-426c-93a2-8d8d8494d951/image.png)

Metabrain is an AI-powered platform designed to help **non-technical digital professionals** and businesses automate tasks and streamline processes—no advanced programming or AI expertise needed. It’s a space where users can create, customize, and share **neurons** (AI micro-applications) to tackle specific workflow challenges.

What sets Metabrain apart is its simplicity and flexibility. Neurons are crafted through prompt flows, designed to automate operational or repetitive tasks. This empowers professionals across various fields—like marketing, HR, administration, and sales—to use AI to increase productivity and focus on high-impact activities.

We operate on a **credit-based model** so users only pay for what they use, with full feature access from the start. This flexibility allows individuals and businesses to scale usage as needed. Users can also **share neurons**, creating a collaborative community of practical solutions.

## **How does it work?**

Metabrain uses "neurons," which are small AI micro-applications. It’s like having a personal assistant that knows exactly what to do at each moment. You can create a neuron that sends a reminder to your coworkers every Monday.

### **Example:**

- **Input:** Reminder for the weekly meeting.
- **Action:** Send an email to all team members.
- **Result:** Everyone receives the reminder.
