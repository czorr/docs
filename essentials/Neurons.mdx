## What is a Neuron?

A **Neuron** in **Metabrain** is a dynamic system of interconnected nodes that work together to generate a **final output of text, webpage, or image**. These neurons function like personalized programs that, through specific instructions, receive input data, process it sequentially, and utilize **artificial intelligence** to deliver coherent results tailored to your needs.

## How Neurons Work

### 1. Nodes as Building Blocks

Each neuron is composed of nodes that can represent text instructions, functions, or **user inputs**. These nodes are executed in sequential order, forming a **chain of commands** that the system follows to construct the final output.

### 2. Sequential Execution

Nodes are executed one by one, from the first to the last, with each result accumulating in the **chain of prompts**, creating a flow of instructions or statements that culminate at the end.

### 3. Customizable Inputs

Neurons allow for the inclusion of customizable **user inputs**, which are dynamic variables that can be modified with each execution. For instance:

<Note>Hello, **\[name]**! How are you today?</Note>
