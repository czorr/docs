### Creating a Neuron

In Metabrain, you can create and customize **Neurons**, which are task flows that allow you to gather inputs (information) from users and utilize AI models to generate automatic results.

* **Input:** Information/form questions - Variable information.

* **Prompt:** Instructions for the neuron. Text.

* **Generation:** Generate a response.

A **Neuron** is a sequence of steps that lets you create interconnected prompts (instructions). This helps you obtain more precise or detailed responses from the AI. To create one, just drag and drop blocks (nodes) onto a canvas to build a flow that best suits your needs.

### Customizing Titles and Descriptions

You can give your Neuron a **title** and a **description**, making it easier to identify and understand its purpose at a glance.

### Adding User Inputs

Neurons allow you to add **user inputs**, which are the answers or information that users need to fill in at various steps of the process. The inputs can be:

* **Short text** – Brief response.

* **Long text** – More detailed response.

* **Options** – A list of choices for the user to select.

* **Dependency** – Uses a run from another neuron as an input.

These inputs integrate into the overall prompt (instruction) and help the AI generate personalized responses. For example, in the following inputs, you can personalize the information about your startup and calculate the CAC.

### Types of Blocks in the Neuron Builder

Within the **Builder**, you can drag different types of **blocks** onto the canvas to construct your Neuron. These include:

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1153b6b1-2569-46bc-9e53-6a94d83691dd/5c7a4d1d-321c-44f1-9046-28a20d76de67/image.png)

**Construction**:

* **Text Prompt:** A block of text that forms part of the instructions, such as "Summarize this article."

* **Comment:** Non-executable blocks that are used for clarification or notes.

**Development:**

* [**Database:**](https://www.notion.so/B-Database-12d04fc6faa98068945ececdbefac318?pvs=21) You can reference a specific table from your databases.

* [**Image Reference:**](https://www.notion.so/B-Image-Reference-12d04fc6faa980c7a847f57eaae489ea?pvs=21) You can add an image URL to use it as context.

**Production:**

* **AI Generation:** This block leverages AI to produce the final text based on prior instructions.

* **Render HTML Page:** This block will use all the above outputs and prompts to generate a new page.

### Running the Neuron

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1153b6b1-2569-46bc-9e53-6a94d83691dd/a7f99d23-02fd-4d5b-99e3-3b74e77daf5f/image.png)

Once you’ve finished creating your Neuron, simply click the **Run** button. The Neuron will process the steps one by one, integrating user inputs and generating results automatically. You’ll be able to see the result in real-time on the right side of the screen.

Neurons empower you to create customized processes and obtain automatic results from the AI tailored to your requirements.

### Sharing Your Neuron

When you’ve completed creating your Neuron, you have two ways to share it with others, depending on who you want to reach and how you want the usage costs to be handled. This flexibility allows you to choose whether you or the end user covers the run cost, making it ideal for different scenarios.

### Options for Sharing a Neuron

1. **Publish Neuron**:

   * **What It Does**: Provides a link you can share with others. Each time someone runs the Neuron, **they cover the cost**.

   * **Ideal For**: Sharing with colleagues, friends, or general audiences who want to explore the Neuron independently without affecting your account’s usage.

   * **How to Use It**: Click **Publish**, copy the link, and share it with anyone you like. Each user will pay per run.

2. **Public Neuron**:

   * **What It Does**: Offers a link that you can share or even embed in a website. In this case, **you cover the cost** for each run.

   * **Ideal For**: Sharing with clients, employees, or integrating the Neuron directly into your website or internal tools where you want to control the cost.

   * **How to Use It**: Click **Make Public**, copy the link or embed code, and share it as needed. You’ll be billed per run, making this option great for controlled environments where users benefit from free access.

***

### Examples of When to Use Each Option

* **Publish Neuron**:

  * Share a Neuron that creates personalized emails, reports, or summaries with your team so they can use it independently.

  * Distribute a marketing tool to friends or peers who want to experiment with generating custom content, with them paying per run.

* **Public Neuron**:

  * Embed a customer feedback tool directly on your website, allowing customers to submit responses while you cover the cost.

  * Provide a client with a Neuron that generates project briefs or customized invoices, with the usage costs covered by you for ease of access.

### **Runs History**

In this section, you can review the **results** and **inputs** from each execution (Run) your Neuron has had. It allows you to see how it has performed in the past and what data was used to generate the outcomes.

### **Cost of Each Run**

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1153b6b1-2569-46bc-9e53-6a94d83691dd/c43c5842-3de5-4add-bcf2-4fddb92ed8ce/image.png)

In the lower left corner of the Neuron, you can monitor the **cost of each execution (Run)**. This will help you manage the credits consumed every time you use the Neuron, giving you control over your resource usage.

### **Deleting a Neuron**

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1153b6b1-2569-46bc-9e53-6a94d83691dd/f3a6f05d-7106-453d-8b4e-5d6291507a05/image.png)

If you no longer need a Neuron, you can **delete** it easily. Just click on the **Delete Neuron** option to remove it from your account.

### **Right Sidebar**

The **right sidebar** contains three helpful tabs to assist you while you build your Neuron:

* **Docs tab:** Here, you can consult the documentation whenever you need it during the building process.

* **Blocks tab:** In this tab, you’ll find information about each block (or node) in your Neuron and can **edit** them as needed.

* **Run tab:** This is where you can view the **result** when you run your Neuron in real-time.

### **Adjusting Size**

You can adjust the size of the panel
