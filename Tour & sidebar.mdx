## Navigation in Metabrain

The Metabrain platform offers intuitive navigation through a **main sidebar** that organizes all the necessary sections for a productive experience. Let’s take a look at each section to guide you in using the platform effectively.

## Search Bar

![Search Bar](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1153b6b1-2569-46bc-9e53-6a94d83691dd/d29e9242-2bdc-4715-882c-a0f5058af229/image.png)

On every page, you’ll find a **search bar** that helps you quickly locate the neurons you’ve created and discover available neurons under “Explore.” This makes it easy to access the tools you need and execute tasks immediately.

## Explore

In the **Explore** section, you’ll find a wide variety of **ready-to-use neurons** created by experts. From contracts and meal plans to marketing strategies, this section allows you to discover pre-designed tools catering to various needs and scenarios.

## Neurons

**Neurons** is the area where you can find all the neurons you’ve created or used recently. You can use the search bar to locate them or click on “view all” to see your entire collection. Additionally, you can organize your neurons into **networks** (sets of related neurons) for better management of your work. For example:

- **Personal Finance Management Network**: Includes neurons for financial assessment, weekly budgeting, expense planning, and investment planning.

## [Databases](https://www.notion.so/B-Database-12d04fc6faa98068945ececdbefac318?pvs=21)

![Databases](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1153b6b1-2569-46bc-9e53-6a94d83691dd/fdac978a-4a2d-4f92-b90a-298f1eacc618/image.png)

The special **Database** block allows you to incorporate and manage datasets within your neurons, almost like dealing with a CSV file. To use databases in your neurons, you must first upload them in the Databases section. You can:

- **Upload** a database file
- **Paste** data
- **Create** a database from scratch

This feature is ideal for analyzing large volumes of data or quickly and mass-referencing information.

## Integrations

In **Integrations**, you can connect Metabrain with external tools you wish to use within your neurons. Integrations are divided into **installed** and **available**, and to use them, you only need to connect your accounts and configure their use within the selected neurons.

## Create Neuron

The **Create Neuron** button (with a direct link to the builder) allows users to initiate the process of creating customized neurons.

## Account (Settings)

At the bottom of the sidebar, you’ll find the **Account** section, where you can personalize your profile, configure the platform's theme, and manage the credit store. Here, you can also handle the general settings of your account.
